This program allows preregistered users to login.  Each login has different access levels
that allows them to access different portions of the menu.
If an incorrect username or password is submitted, the program will ask you to
submit it again.  The program also checks if the username and password belong to
the same set.
Testing Instructions:
Use the provided passwords and usernames in the newUserPass.txt file.  The usernames include
admin, limited, and low, and passwords are pass3, pass2, and pass1 respectively.  Any usernames/passwords
other than these should NOT work.  Furthermore, low user has access to only the Time Reporting Area (1)
menu page, limited has access to both Time Reporting Area and Accounting Area (1 and 2), and admin has
access to all 3 menu pages (1, 2, and 3).
